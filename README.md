This notebook walks you through integrating Qualifire with a LangGraph agent to achieve comprehensive observability, including logging, tracing, and insights via OpenTelemetry.

## Overview

Modern AI applications increasingly rely on sophisticated, multi-step AI agents. These agents often involve multiple LLM calls, interactions with various tools, and complex decision-making processes. Gaining clear visibility into these intricate workflows is a significant challenge. On top of all of that you might also encounter hallucinations, poor tool selection quality and other AI related risks.

## Why Qualifire for Agent Observability?

- **End-to-End Tracing**: Track every step of your agent's execution, from initial prompt to final output
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Get immediate insights into your agent's performance and behavior
- **Debug & Troubleshoot**: Quickly identify and resolve issues in your agent's decision-making process
- **Quality Assurance**: Monitor for hallucinations and ensure high-quality tool selection
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Leverage industry-standard observability practices

## Key Methods

1. **Tracing Setup**: Implement distributed tracing to track agent workflows
2. **Logging Integration**: Capture detailed logs of agent operations
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and resource usage
4. **Quality Metrics**: Measure and monitor agent decision quality

## What you will learn

1. Setup tracing and observability in your LangGraph agent
2. Debug and troubleshoot your agent
3. Get real-time agent observability using Qualifire
